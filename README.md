# MacOps


MacOS automate tools and scripts.
AppleScript and [JavaScript for Automation][JXA] (JXA).

## Features:

* Save finder tabs
* Save iTerm2 tabs
* Save sublime tabs
* Save sublime file history from Session

## Motivation

Sometimes application state can be broken, so we need way to restore it especially when MacOS cannot do it.
